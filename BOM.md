# Bill of Materials

Resin (200g for one case and faceplate): [AnyCubic Plant-based UV Resin](https://www.anycubic.com/collections/uv-resin/products/anycubic-plant-based-uv-resin)

16 position socket headers (2 per case): [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/PPTC161LFBN-RC/S7014-ND/810154)

12 position socket headers (2 per case): [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/PPTC121LFBN-RC/S6100-ND/807231)

30 position dual row pin headers (2 per case): [Digi-Key](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/3m/D2530-6002-AR/1886318) or [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/517-D2530-6002-AR)

12mm M3 pan head screws (2 per case): [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Yootop-M3x12mm-Stainless-Phillips-Fastener/dp/B07HD34562/) or any 12mm M3 screw that sits flat against the body of the case. These are Phillips but Trevor prefers hex wrenches. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

M3 square nuts (2 per case): [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/100pack-STAINLESS-STEEL-SQUARE-M3x5-4x1-8/dp/B07G9TTZDB/) or any short, flat, and square M3 nut.

Cable assembly (1 per case): We ordered a batch of custom 3" cables using part number M3CCA-3003J-ND at Digi-Key. Be careful because the [6" version](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/3m/M3CCA-3006J/230853?s=N4IgTCBcDaILIGYDCSCCBaBAGLA2AUugHIAiIAugL5A) of the same cable that they normally stock will not fit inside the case. If you want to fabricate your own cable assemblies (which Trevor finds annoying) then the two parts are [3M Round Conductor Flat Cable](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/?N=5002385+3290278560&rt=rud) and [3M IDC Ribbon Cable Sockets](https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/d/b00038599/) .

While Trevor happens to like the chonky cables you can probably find less expensive means to connect the boards than this particular assembly and connectors. A molex [socket](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/538-501951-3030) and [cable](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/538-15166-0319) might get the job done but YMMV, buyer beware, and all of that.
