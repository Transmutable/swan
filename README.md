# Open hardware source files for the Transmutable Swan™️

These files contain all of the information that you need to construct an elegant, gift-quality case for projects that use the Adafruit Feather standard.

The design files are licensed under the [CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal](https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.txt).

*This license has requirements about using and sharing so please read [the license](LICENSE.md) before using these files.*

The trademarks of "Transmutable™" and "Transmutable Swan™" can only be used by [Transmutable LLC](https://transmutable.com/), the studio run by [Trevor Flowers](https://trevor.smith.name/).

The designs are shared. The names are not. Love you, though.

If you make something cool then sharing pics of it with [Trevor](https://twitter.com/trevorfsmith/) would be cool.

## What's in this repo

There are two printed parts (the case and the faceplate) which are defined by FreeCAD projects (*.FCStd) and STL files. The designs target resin printers but might also work on a filament printer.

There is one circuit board design that is defined by KiCAD files. Follow the directions of your PCB manufacturer to export from KiCAD into a format that they accept. The components for the board are usually not available for assembly by board manufacturers. We solder them by hand. If you find someone who will source and assemble completed boards for a reasonable price then please do DM [Trevor](https://twitter.com/trevorfsmith/).

The [Bill of Materials](BOM.md) lists the other parts that make up the completed case.

## Dang it, I like electronics and not making cases!

That's how we get you! (jk :-) You can [buy them here](https://transmutable.com/goods/).
